# Simple Slides
by Antti Mattila

A simple "web app" for replacing Powerpoint & Keynote. Mostly for my own personal needs. Has practically no fancy features, but hey, very easy to deploy!

## Requirements & dependencies
1. jQuery
2. Chrome / Chromium. Might work in other browsers as well, or then not. Haven't really tried.

## Usage
1. \<div class="slide" /\> represents a single slide. Style as you wish.
2. All .slide:s need to be wrapped in \<div id="presentation" /\>.
3. Include jQuery and simpleslides.js.
4. Profit (?)
